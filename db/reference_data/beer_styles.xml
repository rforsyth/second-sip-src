They worked with the ingredients that were native to America to create a unique version of the original Pilsner. This style died out after Prohibition but was resurrected as a home-brewed style by advocates of the hobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Six-row barley with 20% to 30% flaked maize to dilute the excessive protein levels. Native American hops such as Clusters, traditional continental noble hops, or modern noble crosses (Ultra, Liberty, Crystal) are also appropriate. Modern American hops such as Cascade are inappropriate. Water with a high mineral content can lead to an inappropriate coarseness in flavor and harshness in aftertaste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

Many Mexican amber and dark lagers used to be more authentic, but unfortunately are now more like sweet, adjunct-laden American Dark Lagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; The original amber lager developed by Anton Dreher shortly after the isolation of lager yeast. Nearly extinct in its area of origin, the style continues in Mexico where it was brought by Santiago Graf and other Austrian immigrant brewers in the late 1800s. Regrettably, most modern examples use adjuncts which lessen the rich malt complexity characteristic of the best examples of this style. The style owes much of its character to the method of malting (Vienna malt). Lighter malt character overall than Oktoberfest, yet still decidedly balanced toward malt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Vienna malt provides a lightly toasty and complex, melanoidin-rich malt profile. As with Oktoberfests, only the finest quality malt should be used, along with Continental hops (preferably noble varieties). Moderately hard, carbonate-rich water.

Served in autumn amidst traditional celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Grist varies, although German Vienna malt is often the backbone of the grain bill, with some Munich malt, Pils malt, and possibly some crystal malt. All malt should derive from the finest quality two-row barley. Continental hops, especially noble varieties, are most authentic.

Produced by ale brewers to compete with lager brewers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States. Originally known as sparkling or present use ales, lager strains were (and sometimes still are) used by some brewers, but were not historically mixed with ale strains. Many examples are kr&amp;auml;usened to achieve carbonation. Cold conditioning isn&amp;iacute;t traditional, although modern brewers sometimes use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; American ingredients most commonly used. A grain bill of six-row malt, or a combination of six-row and North American two-row, is common. Adjuncts can include up to 20% flaked maize in the mash, and up to 20% glucose or other sugars in the boil. Soft water preferred. Any variety of hops can be used for bittering and finishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

Allow for a range of variation within the style when judging. Note that drier versions may seem hoppier or more bitter than the IBU specifications might suggest. Due to its delicate flavor profile, K&amp;ouml;lsch tends to have a relatively short shelf-life; older examples can show some oxidation defects. Some K&amp;ouml;ln breweries (e.g., Dom, Hellers) are now producing young, unfiltered versions known as Wiess (which should not be entered in this category).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; K&amp;ouml;lsch is an appellation protected by the K&amp;ouml;lsch Konvention, and is restricted to the 20 or so breweries in and around Cologne (K&amp;ouml;ln). The Konvention simply defines the beer as a &amp;igrave;light, highly attenuated, hop-accentuated, clear top-fermenting Vollbier.&amp;icirc;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; German noble hops (Hallertau, Tettnang, Spalt or Hersbrucker). German Pils or pale malt. Attenuative, clean ale yeast. Up to 20% wheat may be used, but this is quite rare in authentic versions. Water can vary from extremely soft to moderately hard. Traditionally uses a step mash program, although good results can be obtained using a single rest at 149?F.

Thick, creamy, long-lasting off-white head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flavor:&lt;/b&gt; Assertive hop bitterness well balanced by a sturdy yet clean and crisp malt character. The malt presence is moderated by moderately-high to high attenuation, but considerable rich and complex malt flavors remain. Some fruity esters may survive the lagering period. A long-lasting, medium-dry to dry, bittersweet or nutty finish reflects both the hop bitterness and malt complexity. Noble hop flavor can be moderate to low. No roasted malt flavors or harshness. No diacetyl. Some yeast strains may impart a slight sulfury character. A light minerally character is also sometimes present in the finish, but is not required. The apparent bitterness level is sometimes masked by the high malt character; the bitterness can seem as low as moderate if the finish is not very dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouthfeel:&lt;/b&gt; Medium-bodied. Smooth. Medium to medium-high carbonation. Astringency low to none. Despite being very full of flavor, is light bodied enough to be consumed as a session beer in its home brewpubs in D&amp;uuml;sseldorf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall Impression:&lt;/b&gt; A well balanced, bitter yet malty, clean, smooth, well-attenuated amber-colored German ale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt; A bitter beer balanced by a pronounced malt richness. Fermented at cool ale temperature (60-65?F), and lagered at cold temperatures to produce a cleaner, smoother palate than is typical for most ales. Common variants include Sticke (&amp;igrave;secret&amp;icirc;) alt, which is slightly stronger, darker, richer and more complex than typical alts. Bitterness rises up to 60 IBUs and is usually dry hopped and lagered for a longer time. M&amp;uuml;nster alt is typically lower in gravity and alcohol, sour, lighter in color (golden), and can contain a significant portion of wheat. Both Sticke alt and M&amp;uuml;nster alt should be entered in the specialty category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; The traditional style of beer from D&amp;uuml;sseldorf. &amp;igrave;Alt&amp;icirc; refers to the &amp;igrave;old&amp;icirc; style of brewing (i.e., making top-fermented ales) that was common before lager brewing became popular. Predates the isolation of bottom-fermenting yeast strains, though it approximates many characteristics of lager beers. The best examples can be found in brewpubs in the Altstadt (&amp;igrave;old town&amp;icirc;) section of D&amp;uuml;sseldorf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Grists vary, but usually consist of German base malts (usually Pils, sometimes Munich) with small amounts of crystal, chocolate, and/or black malts used to adjust color. Occasionally will include some wheat. Spalt hops are traditional, but other noble hops can also be used. Moderately carbonate water. Clean, highly attenuative ale yeast. A step mash or decoction mash program is traditional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales. A rather broad style that allows for considerable interpretation by the brewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt; More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with old ales, although strong bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter. Fuller&amp;iacute;s ESB is a unique beer with a very large, complex malt profile not found in other examples; most strong bitters are fruitier and hoppier. Judges should not judge all beers in this style as if they were Fuller&amp;iacute;s ESB clones. Some modern English variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU levels are often not adjusted, so the versions available in the US often do not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. English pale ales are generally considered a premium, export-strength pale, bitter beer that roughly approximates a strong bitter, although reformulated for bottling (including containing higher carbonation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily &amp;igrave;more premium&amp;icirc; since best bitters are traditionally the brewer&amp;iacute;s finest product). Since beer is sold by strength in the UK, these beers often have some alcohol flavor (perhaps to let the consumer know they are getting their due). In England today, &amp;igrave;ESB&amp;icirc; is a brand unique to Fullers; in America, the name has been co-opted to describe a malty, bitter, reddish, standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale. Hopping can be English or a combination of English and American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Pale ale, amber, and/or crystal malts, may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment.

Most beers finish fairly dry considering their relatively sweet palate, and as such have a different balance than strong Scotch ales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt; The malt-hop balance is slightly to moderately tilted towards the malt side. Any caramelization comes from kettle caramelization and not caramel malt (and is sometimes confused with diacetyl). Although unusual, any smoked character is yeast- or water-derived and not from the use of peat-smoked malts. Use of peat-smoked malt to replicate the peaty character should be restrained; overly smoky beers should be entered in the Other Smoked Beer category (22B) rather than here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; Traditional Scottish session beers reflecting the indigenous ingredients (water, malt), with less hops than their English counterparts (due to the need to import them). Long, cool fermentations are traditionally used in Scottish brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Scottish or English pale base malt. Small amounts of roasted barley add color and flavor, and lend a dry, slightly roasty finish. English hops. Clean, relatively un-attenuative ale yeast. Some commercial brewers add small amounts of crystal, amber, or wheat malts, and adjuncts such as sugar. The optional peaty, earthy and/or smoky character comes from the traditional yeast and from the local malt and water rather than using smoked malts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

Bottled versions are typically brewed from a significantly higher OG and may be designated as foreign extra stouts (if sufficiently strong). While most commercial versions rely primarily on roasted barley as the dark grain, others use chocolate malt, black malt or combinations of the three. The level of bitterness is somewhat variable, as is the roasted character and the dryness of the finish; allow for interpretation by brewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; The style evolved from attempts to capitalize on the success of London porters, but originally reflected a fuller, creamier, more &amp;igrave;stout&amp;icirc; body and strength. When a brewery offered a stout and a porter, the stout was always the stronger beer (it was originally called a &amp;igrave;Stout Porter&amp;icirc;). Modern versions are brewed from a lower OG and no longer reflect a higher strength than porters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; The dryness comes from the use of roasted unmalted barley in addition to pale malt, moderate to high hop bitterness, and good attenuation. Flaked unmalted barley may also be used to add creaminess. A small percentage (perhaps 3%) of soured beer is sometimes added for complexity (generally by Guinness only). Water typically has moderate carbonate hardness, although high levels will not give the classic dry finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

Some bottled export (i.e., stronger) versions of dry or sweet stout also fit this profile. Guinness Foreign Extra Stout has been made since the early 1800s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Similar to dry or sweet stout, but with more gravity. Pale and dark roasted malts and grains. Hops mostly for bitterness. May use adjuncts and sugar to boost gravity.

The roasted malt character can take on coffee, dark chocolate, or slightly burnt tones and can be light to moderately strong. The malt aroma can be subtle to rich and barleywine-like, depending on the gravity and grain bill. May optionally show a slight specialty malt character (e.g., caramel), but this should only add complexity and not dominate. Fruity esters may be low to moderately strong, and may take on a complex, dark fruit (e.g., plums, prunes, raisins) character. Hop aroma can be very low to quite aggressive, and may contain any hop variety. An alcohol character may be present, but shouldn&amp;iacute;t be sharp, hot or solventy. Aged versions may have a slight vinous or port-like quality, but shouldn&amp;iacute;t be sour. No diacetyl. The balance can vary with any of the aroma elements taking center stage.

Aging affects the intensity, balance and smoothness of aromatics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appearance:&lt;/b&gt; Color may range from very dark reddish-brown to jet black. Opaque.

Medium to aggressively high bitterness. Medium-low to high hop flavor (any variety). Moderate to aggressively high roasted malt/grain flavors can suggest bittersweet or unsweetened chocolate, cocoa, and/or strong coffee. A slightly burnt grain, burnt currant or tarry character may be evident. Fruity esters may be low to intense, and can take on a dark fruit character (raisins, plums, or prunes). Malt backbone can be balanced and supportive to rich and barleywine-like, and may optionally show some supporting caramel, bready or toasty flavors. Alcohol strength should be evident, but not hot, sharp, or solventy. No diacetyl. The palate and finish can vary from relatively dry to moderately sweet, usually with some lingering roastiness, hop bitterness and warming character. The balance and intensity of flavors can be affected by aging, with some flavors becoming more subdued over time and some aged, vinous or port-like qualities developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouthfeel:&lt;/b&gt; Full to very full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture (although the body may decline with long conditioning).

A slightly grassy dry-hop aroma is acceptable, but not required. A moderate caramel-like or toasty malt presence is common. Low to moderate fruitiness, either from esters or hops, can be present. Some versions may have a sulfury note, although this character is not mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appearance:&lt;/b&gt; Color ranges from golden amber to light copper, but most are pale to medium amber with an orange-ish tint. Should be clear, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be a bit hazy. Good head stand with off-white color should persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flavor:&lt;/b&gt; Hop flavor is medium to high, with a moderate to assertive hop bitterness. The hop flavor should be similar to the aroma (floral, earthy, fruity, and/or slightly grassy). Malt flavor should be medium-low to medium-high, but should be noticeable, pleasant, and support the hop aspect. The malt should show an English character and be somewhat bready, biscuit-like, toasty, toffee-like and/or caramelly. Despite the substantial hop character typical of these beers, sufficient malt flavor, body and complexity to support the hops will provide the best balance. Very low levels of diacetyl are acceptable, and fruitiness from the fermentation or hops adds to the overall complexity. Finish is medium to dry, and bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not be harsh. If high sulfate water is used, a distinctively minerally, dry finish, some sulfur flavor, and a lingering bitterness are usually present. Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in stronger versions. Oak is inappropriate in this style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouthfeel:&lt;/b&gt; Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied mouthfeel without hop-derived astringency, although moderate to medium-high carbonation can combine to render an overall dry sensation in the presence of malt sweetness.

Modern versions of English IPAs generally pale in comparison (pun intended) to their ancestors. The term &amp;igrave;IPA&amp;icirc; is loosely applied in commercial English beers today, and has been (incorrectly) used in beers below 4% ABV. Generally will have more finish hops and less fruitiness and/or caramel than English pale ales and bitters. Fresher versions will obviously have a more significant finishing hop character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; Brewed to survive the voyage from England to India. The temperature extremes and rolling of the seas resulted in a highly attenuated beer upon arrival. English pale ales were derived from India Pale Ales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Pale ale malt (well-modified and suitable for single-temperature infusion mashing); English hops; English yeast that can give a fruity or sulfury/minerally profile. Refined sugar may be used in some versions. High sulfate and low carbonate water is essential to achieving a pleasant hop bitterness in authentic Burton versions, although not all examples will exhibit the strong sulfate character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

Other traditional beer styles with enough rye added to give a noticeable rye character should be entered in the Specialty Beer category (23). Rye is a huskless grain and is difficult to mash, often resulting in a gummy mash texture that is prone to sticking. Rye has been characterized as having the most assertive flavor of all cereal grains. It is inappropriate to add caraway seeds to a roggenbier (as some American brewers do); the rye character is traditionally from the rye grain only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; A specialty beer originally brewed in Regensburg, Bavaria as a more distinctive variant of a dunkelweizen using malted rye instead of malted wheat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Malted rye typically constitutes 50% or greater of the grist (some versions have 60-65% rye). Remainder of grist can include pale malt, Munich malt, wheat malt, crystal malt and/or small amounts of debittered dark malts for color adjustment. Weizen yeast provides distinctive banana esters and clove phenols. Light usage of noble hops in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Lower fermentation temperatures accentuate the clove character by suppressing ester formation. Decoction mash commonly used (as with weizenbiers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

Overly spiced and/or sour beers are not good examples of the style. Coriander of certain origins might give an inappropriate ham or celery character. The beer tends to be fragile and does not age well, so younger, fresher, properly handled examples are most desirable. Most examples seem to be approximately 5% ABV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; A 400-year-old beer style that died out in the 1950s; it was later revived by Pierre Celis at Hoegaarden, and has grown steadily in popularity over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; About 50% unmalted wheat (traditionally soft white winter wheat) and 50% pale barley malt (usually Pils malt) constitute the grist. In some versions, up to 5-10% raw oats may be used. Spices of freshly-ground coriander and Cura&amp;ccedil;ao or sometimes sweet orange peel complement the sweet aroma and are quite characteristic. Other spices (e.g., chamomile, cumin, cinnamon, Grains of Paradise) may be used for complexity but are much less prominent. Ale yeast prone to the production of mild, spicy flavors is very characteristic. In some instances a very limited lactic fermentation, or the actual addition of lactic acid, is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

A low to moderate tart character may be present but should be refreshing and not to the point of puckering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall Impression:&lt;/b&gt; A refreshing, medium to strong fruity/spicy ale with a distinctive yellow-orange color, highly carbonated, well hopped, and dry with a quenching acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt; Varying strength examples exist (table beers of about 5% strength, typical export beers of about 6.5%, and stronger versions of 8%+). Strong versions (6.5%-9.5%) and darker versions (copper to dark brown/black) should be entered as Belgian Specialty Ales (16E). Sweetness decreases and spice, hop and sour character increases with strength. Herb and spice additions often reflect the indigenous varieties available at the brewery. High carbonation and extreme attenuation (85-95%) helps bring out the many flavors and to increase the perception of a dry finish. All of these beers share somewhat higher levels of acidity than other Belgian styles while the optional sour flavor is often a variable house character of a particular brewery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; A seasonal summer style produced in Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium. Originally brewed at the end of the cool season to last through the warmer months before refrigeration was common. It had to be sturdy enough to last for months but not too strong to be quenching and refreshing in the summer. It is now brewed year-round in tiny, artisanal breweries whose buildings reflect their origins as farmhouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Pilsner malt dominates the grist though a portion of Vienna and/or Munich malt contributes color and complexity. Sometimes contains other grains such as wheat and spelt. Adjuncts such as sugar and honey can also serve to add complexity and thin the body. Hop bitterness and flavor may be more noticeable than in many other Belgian styles. A saison is sometimes dry-hopped. Noble hops, Styrian or East Kent Goldings are commonly used. A wide variety of herbs and spices are often used to add complexity and uniqueness in the stronger versions, but should always meld well with the yeast and hop character. Varying degrees of acidity and/or sourness can be created by the use of gypsum, acidulated malt, a sour mash or Lactobacillus. Hard water, common to most of Wallonia, can accentuate the bitterness and dry finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

The darker versions will have more malt character, while the paler versions can have more hops (but still are malt-focused beers). A related style is Bi&amp;egrave;re de Mars, which is brewed in March (Mars) for present use and will not age as well. Attenuation rates are in the 80-85% range. Some fuller-bodied examples exist, but these are somewhat rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; Name literally means &amp;igrave;beer which has been kept or lagered.&amp;icirc; A traditional artisanal farmhouse ale from Northern France brewed in early spring and kept in cold cellars for consumption in warmer weather. It is now brewed year-round. Related to the Belgian Saison style, the main difference is that the Bi&amp;egrave;re de Garde is rounder, richer, sweeter, malt-focused, often has a &amp;igrave;cellar&amp;icirc; character, and lacks the spicing and tartness of a Saison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; The &amp;igrave;cellar&amp;icirc; character in commercial examples is unlikely to be duplicated in homebrews as it comes from indigenous yeasts and molds. Commercial versions often have a &amp;igrave;corked&amp;icirc;, dry, astringent character that is often incorrectly identified as &amp;igrave;cellar-like.&amp;icirc; Homebrews therefore are usually cleaner. Base malts vary by beer color, but usually include pale, Vienna and Munich types. Kettle caramelization tends to be used more than crystal malts, when present. Darker versions will have richer malt complexity and sweetness from crystal-type malts. Sugar may be used to add flavor and aid in the dry finish. Lager or ale yeast fermented at cool ale temperatures, followed by long cold conditioning (4-6 weeks for commercial operations). Soft water. Floral, herbal or spicy continental hops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

The category can be used for clones of specific beers (e.g., Orval, La Chouffe); to produce a beer fitting a broader style that doesn&amp;iacute;t have its own category; or to create an artisanal or experimental beer of the brewer&amp;iacute;s own choosing (e.g., strong Belgian golden ale with spices, something unique).

Only two traditional breweries still produce the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Wheat malt content is typically 50% of the grist (as with all German wheat beers) with the remainder being Pilsner malt. A symbiotic fermentation with top-fermenting yeast and &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus delbruckii&lt;/i&gt; provides the sharp sourness, which may be enhanced by blending of beers of different ages during fermentation and by extended cool aging. Hop bitterness is extremely low. A single decoction mash with mash hopping is traditional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

It was once common in Belgium and England to blend old beer with young to balance the sourness and acidity found in aged beer.

A deeper malt character distinguishes these beers from Flanders red ales. This style was designed to lay down so examples with a moderate aged character are considered superior to younger examples. As in fruit lambics, Oud Bruin can be used as a base for fruit-flavored beers such as kriek (cherries) or frambozen (raspberries), though these should be entered in the classic-style fruit beer category. The Oud Bruin is less acetic and maltier than a Flanders Red, and the fruity flavors are more malt-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; An &amp;igrave;old ale&amp;icirc; tradition, indigenous to East Flanders, typified by the products of the Liefman brewery (now owned by Riva), which has roots back to the 1600s. Historically brewed as a &amp;igrave;provision beer&amp;icirc; that would develop some sourness as it aged. These beers were typically more sour than current commercial examples. While Flanders red beers are aged in oak, the brown beers are warm aged in stainless steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; A base of Pils malt with judicious amounts of dark cara malts and a tiny bit of black or roast malt. Often includes maize. Low alpha acid continental hops are typical (avoid high alpha or distinctive American hops). Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus (and acetobacter) contribute to the fermentation and eventual flavor. Lactobacillus reacts poorly to elevated levels of alcohol. A sour mash or acidulated malt may also be used to develop the sour character without introducing Lactobacillus. Water high in carbonates is typical of its home region and will buffer the acidity of darker malts and the lactic sourness. Magnesium in the water accentuates the sourness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

Since they are unblended, the straight lambic is often a true product of the &amp;igrave;house character&amp;icirc; of a brewery and will be more variable than a gueuze. They are generally served young (6 months) and on tap as cheap, easy-drinking beers without any filling carbonation. Younger versions tend to be one-dimensionally sour since a complex Brett character often takes upwards of a year to develop. An enteric character is often indicative of a lambic that is too young. A noticeable vinegary or cidery character is considered a fault by Belgian brewers. Since the wild yeast and bacteria will ferment ALL sugars, they are bottled only when they have completely fermented. Lambic is served uncarbonated, while gueuze is served effervescent. IBUs are approximate since aged hops are used; Belgians use hops for anti-bacterial properties more than bittering in lambics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; Spontaneously fermented sour ales from the area in and around Brussels (the Senne Valley) stem from a farmhouse brewing tradition several centuries old.

The aged hops are used more for preservative effects than bitterness, and makes actual bitterness levels difficult to estimate. Traditionally these beers are spontaneously fermented with naturally-occurring yeast and bacteria in predominately oaken barrels. Home-brewed and craft-brewed versions are more typically made with pure cultures of yeast commonly including Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus in an attempt to recreate the effects of the dominant microbiota of Brussels and the surrounding countryside of the Senne River valley.

Their numbers are constantly dwindling and some are untraditionally sweetening their products (post-fermentation) with sugar or sweet fruit to make them more palatable to a wider audience.

Fruits traditionally used include tart cherries (with pits), raspberries or Muscat grapes. More recent examples include peaches, apricots or merlot grapes. Tart or acidic fruit is traditionally used as its purpose is not to sweeten the beer but to add a new dimension.

Moderately malty or sweet on palate. Finish is variable depending on interpretation (authentic Trappist versions are moderately dry to dry, Abbey versions can be medium-dry to sweet). Low bitterness for a beer of this strength; alcohol provides some of the balance to the malt. Sweeter and more full-bodied beers will have a higher bitterness level to balance.

Higher bitterness is allowable in Abbey-style beers with a higher FG. Barleywine-type beers (e.g., Scaldis/Bush, La Trappe Quadrupel, Weyerbacher QUAD) and Spiced/Christmas-type beers (e.g., N&amp;iacute;ice Chouffe, Affligem N&amp;ouml;el) should be entered in the Belgian Specialty Ale category (16E), not this category.

Impression of a complex grain bill, although many traditional versions are quite simple, with caramelized sugar syrup or unrefined sugars and yeast providing much of the complexity. Homebrewers may use Belgian Pils or pale base malt, Munich-type malts for maltiness, other Belgian specialty grains for character. Caramelized sugar syrup or unrefined sugars lightens body and adds color and flavor (particularly if dark sugars are used). Noble-type, English-type or Styrian Goldings hops commonly used. Spices generally not used; if used, keep subtle and in the background. Avoid US/UK crystal type malts (these provide the wrong type of sweetness).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

Fits in the style space between normal gravity beers (strong bitters, brown porters) and barleywines. Can include winter warmers, strong dark milds, strong (and perhaps darker) bitters, blended strong beers (stock ale blended with a mild or bitter), and lower gravity versions of English barleywines. Many English examples, particularly winter warmers, are lower than 6% ABV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; A traditional English ale style, mashed at higher temperatures than strong ales to reduce attenuation, then aged at the brewery after primary fermentation (similar to the process used for historical porters). Often had age-related character (lactic, Brett, oxidation, leather) associated with &amp;igrave;stale&amp;icirc; beers. Used as stock ales for blending or enjoyed at full strength (stale or stock refers to beers that were aged or stored for a significant period of time). Winter warmers are a more modern style that are maltier, fuller-bodied, often darker beers that may be a brewery&amp;iacute;s winter seasonal special offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Generous quantities of well-modified pale malt (generally English in origin, though not necessarily so), along with judicious quantities of caramel malts and other specialty character malts. Some darker examples suggest that dark malts (e.g., chocolate, black malt) may be appropriate, though sparingly so as to avoid an overly roasted character. Adjuncts (such as molasses, treacle, invert sugar or dark sugar) are often used, as are starchy adjuncts (maize, flaked barley, wheat) and malt extracts. Hop variety is not as important, as the relative balance and aging process negate much of the varietal character. British ale yeast that has low attenuation, but can handle higher alcohol levels, is traditional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

The fruit character should be pleasant and supportive, not artificial and inappropriately overpowering (considering the character of the fruit) nor should it have defects such as oxidation. As with all specialty beers, a proper fruit beer should be a harmonious balance of the featured fruit(s) with the underlying beer style. Aroma hops, yeast by-products and malt components of the underlying beer may not be as noticeable when fruit are present. These components (especially hops) may also be intentionally subdued to allow the fruit character to come through in the final presentation. If the base beer is an ale then a non-specific fruitiness and/or other fermentation by-products such as diacetyl may be present as appropriate for warmer fermentations. If the base beer is a lager, then overall less fermentation byproducts would be appropriate. Some malt aroma may be desirable, especially in dark styles. Hop aroma may be absent or balanced with fruit, depending on the style. The fruit should add an extra complexity to the beer, but not be so prominent as to unbalance the resulting presentation. Some tartness may be present if naturally occurring in the particular fruit(s), but should not be inappropriately intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appearance:&lt;/b&gt; Appearance should be appropriate to the base beer being presented and will vary depending on the base beer. For lighter-colored beers with fruits that exhibit distinctive colors, the color should be noticeable. Note that the color of fruit in beer is often lighter than the flesh of the fruit itself and may take on slightly different shades. Fruit beers may have some haze or be clear, although haze is a generally undesirable. The head may take on some of the color of the fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flavor:&lt;/b&gt; As with aroma, the distinctive flavor character associated with the particular fruit(s) should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive. The balance of fruit with the underlying beer is vital, and the fruit character should not be so artificial and/or inappropriately overpowering as to suggest a fruit juice drink. Hop bitterness, flavor, malt flavors, alcohol content, and fermentation by-products, such as esters or diacetyl, should be appropriate to the base beer and be harmonious and balanced with the distinctive fruit flavors present. Note that these components (especially hops) may be intentionally subdued to allow the fruit character to come through in the final presentation. Some tartness may be present if naturally occurring in the particular fruit(s), but should not be inappropriately intense. Remember that fruit generally add flavor not sweetness to fruit beers. The sugar found in fruit is usually fully fermented and contributes to lighter flavors and a drier finish than might be expected for the declared base style. However, residual sweetness is not necessarily a negative characteristic unless it has a raw, unfermented quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouthfeel:&lt;/b&gt; Mouthfeel may vary depending on the base beer selected and as appropriate to that base beer. Body and carbonation levels should be appropriate to the base beer style being presented. Fruit generally adds fermentables that tend to thin out the beer; the resulting beer may seem lighter than expected for the declared base style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall Impression:&lt;/b&gt; A harmonious marriage of fruit and beer. The key attributes of the underlying style will be different with the addition of fruit; do not expect the base beer to taste the same as the unadulterated version. Judge the beer based on the pleasantness and balance of the resulting combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt; Overall balance is the key to presenting a well-made fruit beer.

Aged fruit may sometimes have flavor and aroma characteristics similar to Sauternes, Sherry or Tokaj, but a beer with a quality such as this should make a special claim (e.g., amontillado, fino, botrytis). Beer with chile peppers should be entered in the Spice/Herb/Vegetable Beer category (21A).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

The individual character of the SHV(s) may not always be identifiable when used in combination. The SHV character should be pleasant and supportive, not artificial and overpowering. As with all specialty beers, a proper SHV beer should be a harmonious balance of the featured SHV(s) with the underlying beer style. Aroma hops, yeast by-products and malt components of the underlying beer may not be as noticeable when SHV are present. These components (especially hops) may also be intentionally subdued to allow the SHV character to come through in the final presentation. If the base beer is an ale then a non-specific fruitiness and/or other fermentation by-products such as diacetyl may be present as appropriate for warmer fermentations. If the base beer is a lager, then overall less fermentation byproducts would be appropriate. Some malt aroma is preferable, especially in dark styles. Hop aroma may be absent or balanced with SHV, depending on the style. The SHV(s) should add an extra complexity to the beer, but not be so prominent as to unbalance the resulting presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appearance:&lt;/b&gt; Appearance should be appropriate to the base beer being presented and will vary depending on the base beer.

The individual character of the SHV(s) may not always be identifiable when used in combination. The balance of SHV with the underlying beer is vital, and the SHV character should not be so artificial and/or overpowering as to overwhelm the beer. Hop bitterness, flavor, malt flavors, alcohol content, and fermentation by-products, such as esters or diacetyl, should be appropriate to the base beer and be harmonious and balanced with the distinctive SHV flavors present. Note that these components (especially hops) may be intentionally subdued to allow the SHV character to come through in the final presentation. Some SHV(s) are inherently bitter and may result in a beer more bitter than the declared base style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouthfeel:&lt;/b&gt; Mouthfeel may vary depending on the base beer selected and as appropriate to that base beer. Body and carbonation levels should be appropriate to the base beer style being presented. Some SHV(s) may add additional body and/or slickness, although fermentable additions may thin out the beer. Some SHV(s) may add a bit of astringency, although a &amp;igrave;raw&amp;icirc; spice character is undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall Impression:&lt;/b&gt; A harmonious marriage of spices, herbs and/or vegetables and beer. The key attributes of the underlying style will be different with the addition of spices, herbs and/or vegetables; do not expect the base beer to taste the same as the unadulterated version.

Any combination of aromatics that suggests the holiday season is welcome. The base beer style often has a malty profile that supports the balanced presentation of the aromatics from spices and possibly other special ingredients. Additional fermentables (e.g., honey, molasses, maple syrup, etc.) may lend their own unique aromatics. Hop aromatics are often absent, subdued, or slightly spicy. Some fruit character (often of dried citrus peel, or dried fruit such as raisins or plums) is optional but acceptable. Alcohol aromatics may be found in some examples, but this character should be restrained. The overall aroma should be balanced and harmonious, and is often fairly complex and inviting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appearance:&lt;/b&gt; Generally medium amber to very dark brown (darker versions are more common).

Spices associated with the holiday season are typical (as mentioned in the Aroma section). The spices and optional fermentables should be supportive and blend well with the base beer style. Rich, malty and/or sweet malt-based flavors are common, and may include caramel, toast, nutty, or chocolate flavors. May include some dried fruit or dried fruit peel flavors such as raisin, plum, fig, orange peel or lemon peel. May include distinctive flavors from specific fermentables (molasses, honey, brown sugar, etc.), although these elements are not required. A light spruce or other evergreen tree character is optional but found in some examples. The wide range of special ingredients should be supportive and balanced, not so prominent as to overshadow the base beer. Bitterness and hop flavor are generally restrained so as to not interfere with the spices and special ingredients. Generally finishes rather full and satisfying, and often has some alcohol flavor. Roasted malt characteristics are rare, and not usually stronger than chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouthfeel:&lt;/b&gt; A wide range of interpretations is possible. Body is generally medium to full, and a certain malty chewiness is often present. Moderately low to moderately high carbonation is typical. Many examples will show some well-aged, warming alcohol content, but without being overly hot. The beers do not have to be overly strong to show some warming effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall Impression:&lt;/b&gt; A stronger, darker, spiced beer that often has a rich body and warming finish suggesting a good accompaniment for the cold winter season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt; Overall balance is the key to presenting a well-made Christmas beer. The special ingredients should complement the base beer and not overwhelm it. The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles and special ingredients work well together while others do not make for harmonious combinations. &lt;b&gt;THE ENTRANT &lt;u&gt;MAY&lt;/u&gt; DECLARE AN UNDERLYING BEER STYLE AS WELL AS THE SPECIAL INGREDIENTS USED. THE BASE STYLE, SPICES OR OTHER INGREDIENTS NEED &lt;u&gt;NOT&lt;/u&gt; BE IDENTIFIED.

OR FRUIT.&lt;/b&gt; If the base beer is a classic style, the original style should come through in aroma and flavor. Whenever spices, herbs or additional fermentables are declared, each should be noticeable and distinctive in its own way (although not necessarily individually identifiable; balanced with the other ingredients is still critical). English-style Winter Warmers (some of which may be labeled Christmas Ales) are generally not spiced, and should be entered as Old Ales. Belgian-style Christmas ales should be entered as Belgian Specialty Ales (16E).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; Throughout history, beer of a somewhat higher alcohol content and richness has been enjoyed during the winter holidays, when old friends get together to enjoy the season. Many breweries produce unique seasonal offerings that may be darker, stronger, spiced, or otherwise more characterful than their normal beers. Spiced versions are an American or Belgian tradition, since English or German breweries traditionally do not use spices in their beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Generally ales, although some dark strong lagers exist. Spices are required, and often include those evocative of the Christmas season (e.g., allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, ginger) but any combination is possible and creativity is encouraged. Fruit peel (e.g., oranges, lemon) may be used, as may subtle additions of other fruits. May use a wide range of crystal-type malts, particularly those that add dark fruit or caramel flavors. Flavorful adjuncts are often used (e.g., molasses, treacle, invert sugar, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

Smokiness may vary from low to assertive; however, balance in the overall presentation is the key to well-made examples.

For example, &amp;igrave;smoked porter&amp;icirc; is as acceptable as &amp;igrave;peat-smoked strong Scotch ale&amp;icirc; or &amp;igrave;cherry-wood smoked IPA.&amp;icirc; Judges should evaluate the beers mostly on the overall balance, and how well the smoke character enhances the base beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt; The process of using smoked malts more recently has been adapted by craft brewers to other styles, notably porter and strong Scotch ales. German brewers have traditionally used smoked malts in bock, doppelbock, weizen, dunkel, schwarzbier, helles, Pilsner, and other specialty styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt; Different materials used to smoke malt result in unique flavor and aroma characteristics. Beechwood-, peat- or other hardwood (oak, maple, mesquite, alder, pecan, apple, cherry, other fruitwoods) smoked malts may be used. The various woods may remind one of certain smoked products due to their food association (e.g., hickory with ribs, maple with bacon or sausage, and alder with salmon). Evergreen wood should never be used since it adds a medicinal, piney flavor to the malt. Excessive peat-smoked malt is generally undesirable due to its sharp, piercing phenolics and dirt-like earthiness. The remaining ingredients vary with the base style. If smoked malts are combined with other unusual ingredients (fruits, vegetables, spices, honey, etc.) in noticeable quantities, the resulting beer should be entered in the specialty/experimental category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

Higher alcohol levels should not result in &amp;igrave;hot&amp;icirc; beers; aged, smooth flavors are most desirable. Wood can also add tannins to the beer, depending on age of the cask.

Aged in wooden casks or barrels (often previously used to store whiskey, bourbon, port, sherry, Madeira, or wine), or using wood-based additives (wood chips, wood staves, oak essence). Fuller-bodied, higher-gravity base styles often are used since they can best stand up to the additional flavors, although experimentation is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

Overall the aroma should be a pleasant combination of malt, hops and the featured specialty ingredient or nature as appropriate to the specific type of beer being presented. The individual character of special ingredients and processes may not always be identifiable when used in combination. If a classic style base beer is specified then the characteristics of that classic style should be noticeable. Note, however, that classic styles will have a different impression when brewed with unusual ingredients, additives or processes. The typical aroma components of classic beer styles (particularly hops) may be intentionally subdued to allow the special ingredients or nature to be more apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appearance:&lt;/b&gt; Appearance should be appropriate to the base beer being presented and will vary depending on the base beer (if declared). Note that unusual ingredients or processes may affect the appearance so that the result is quite different from the declared base style. Some ingredients may add color (including to the head), and may affect head formation and retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flavor:&lt;/b&gt; As with aroma, the distinctive flavor character associated with the stated specialty nature should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive. The marriage of specialty ingredients or nature with the underlying beer should be harmonious, and the specialty character should not seem artificial and/or totally overpowering. Hop bitterness, flavor, malt flavors, alcohol content, and fermentation by-products, such as esters or diacetyl, should be appropriate to the base beer (if declared) and be well-integrated with the distinctive specialty flavors present. Some ingredients may add tartness, sweetness, or other flavor by-products. Remember that fruit and sugar adjuncts generally add flavor and not excessive sweetness to beer. The sugary adjuncts, as well as sugar found in fruit, are usually fully fermented and contribute to a lighter flavor profile and a drier finish than might be expected for the declared base style. The individual character of special ingredients and processes may not always be identifiable when used in combination. If a classic style base beer is specified then the characteristics of that classic style should be noticeable. Note, however, that classic styles will have a different impression when brewed with unusual ingredients, additives or processes. Note that these components (especially hops) may be intentionally subdued to allow the specialty character to come through in the final presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouthfeel:&lt;/b&gt; Mouthfeel may vary depending on the base beer selected and as appropriate to that base beer (if declared). Body and carbonation levels should be appropriate to the base beer style being presented. Unusual ingredients or processes may affect the mouthfeel so that the result is quite different from the declared base style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall Impression:&lt;/b&gt; A harmonious marriage of ingredients, processes and beer. The key attributes of the underlying style (if declared) will be atypical due to the addition of special ingredients or techniques; do not expect the base beer to taste the same as the unadulterated version. Judge the beer based on the pleasantness and harmony of the resulting combination. The overall uniqueness of the process, ingredients used, and creativity should be considered. The overall rating of the beer depends heavily on the inherently subjective assessment of distinctiveness and drinkability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Base Style:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;THE BREWER MAY SPECIFY AN UNDERLYING BEER STYLE.&lt;/b&gt; The base style may be a &lt;i&gt;classic style&lt;/i&gt; (i.e., a named subcategory from these Style Guidelines) or a broader characterization (e.g., &amp;igrave;Porter&amp;icirc; or &amp;igrave;Brown Ale&amp;icirc;). If a base style is declared, the style should be recognizable. The beer should be judged by how well the special ingredient or process complements, enhances, and harmonizes with the underlying style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt; Overall harmony and drinkability are the keys to presenting a well-made specialty beer. The distinctive nature of the stated specialty ingredients/methods should complement the original style (if declared) and not totally overwhelm it. The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles and ingredients or techniques work well together while others do not make palatable combinations. &lt;b&gt;THE BREWER &lt;u&gt;MUST&lt;/u&gt; SPECIFY THE &amp;igrave;EXPERIMENTAL NATURE&amp;icirc; OF THE BEER (E.G., TYPE OF SPECIAL INGREDIENTS USED, PROCESS UTILIZED OR HISTORICAL STYLE BEING BREWED), OR WHY THE BEER DOESN&amp;iacute;T FIT AN ESTABLISHED STYLE.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;For historical styles or unusual ingredients/techniques that may not be known to all beer judges, the brewer should provide descriptions of the styles, ingredients and/or techniques as an aid to the judges.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&apos;1&apos; cellpadding=&apos;5&apos;&gt;

The herb/spice character should display distinctive aromatics associated with the particular herbs/spices; however, note that some herbs/spices (e.g., ginger, cinnamon) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others (e.g., chamomile, lavender)&amp;oacute;allow for a range of herb/spice character and intensity from subtle to aggressive. The herb/spice character should be pleasant and supportive, not artificial and inappropriately overpowering (considering the character of the herb/spice). In a blended herb/spice metheglin, not all herbs/spices may be individually identifiable or of equal intensity. The honey aroma should be noticeable, and can have a light to significant sweetness that may express the aroma of flower nectar. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities and characters). The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation character, with clean and fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions will have higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose. Some herbs and spices may produce spicy or peppery phenolics. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appearance:&lt;/b&gt; Standard description applies, except perhaps to note that the color usually won&amp;iacute;t be affected by spices and herbs (although flowers, petals and peppers may provide subtle colors; tea blends may provide significant colors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flavor:&lt;/b&gt; The herb/spice flavor intensity may vary from subtle to high; the honey flavor intensity may vary from subtle to high; the residual sweetness may vary from none to high; and the finish may range from dry to sweet, depending on what sweetness level has been declared (dry to sweet) and strength level has been declared (hydromel to sack). The distinctive flavor character associated with the particular herbs/spices may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive (although some herbs/spices may not be individually recognizable, and can just serve to add a background complexity). Certain herbs and spices might add bitter, astringent, phenolic or spicy (hot) flavors; if present, these qualities should be related to the declared ingredients (otherwise, they are faults), and they should balance and blend with the honey, sweetness and alcohol. Metheglins containing more than one herb/spice should have a good balance among the different herbs/spices, though some herbs/spices will tend to dominate the flavor profile. A metheglin may have a subtle to strong honey character, and may feature noticeable to prominent varietal character if a varietal honey is declared (different varieties have different intensities). Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouthfeel:&lt;/b&gt; Standard description applies. Some herbs or spices may contain tannins that add a bit of body and some astringency, but this character should not be excessive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall Impression:&lt;/b&gt; In well-made examples of the style, the herbs/spices are both distinctive and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead. Different types of herbs/spices can result in widely different characteristics; allow for a variation in the final product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt; Often, a blend of spices may give a character greater than the sum of its parts.

A metheglin is a standard mead made with the addition of spices or herbs. Meads made with flowers (such as rose petal mead, or rhodomel), chocolate, coffee, nuts or chile peppers (capsimel/capsicumel) may also be entered in this category, as can meads made with a blend of spices. If spices are used in conjunction with other ingredients such as fruit, cider, or other fermentables, then the mead should be entered as an Open Category Mead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Commercial Examples:&lt;/b&gt; Bonair Chili Mead, Redstone Juniper Mountain Honey Wine, Redstone Vanilla Beans and Cinnamon Sticks Mountain Honey Wine, Long Island Meadery Vanilla Mead, iQhilika Africa Birds Eye Chilli Mead, Mountain Meadows Spice Nectar&lt;/p&gt;</reference></lookup><lookup name='Braggot'><reference url='http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style26.php#1b' type='BJCP'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Braggot is a mead made with malt.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aroma:&lt;/b&gt; Depending on the sweetness, strength and base style of beer, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and beer character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The honey and beer/malt character should be complementary and balanced, although not always evenly balanced. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities and characters). If a base style of beer or type of malt is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable character reflective of the beer style (different styles and malts have different intensities and characters).

Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appearance:&lt;/b&gt; Standard description does not apply due to beer-like characteristics. Clarity may be good to brilliant, although many braggots are not as clear as other meads. A light to moderate head with some retention is expected. Color may range from light straw to dark brown or black, depending on the variety of malt and honey used. The color should be characteristic of the declared beer style and/or honey used, if a variety is declared. Stronger versions may show signs of body (e.g., legs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flavor:&lt;/b&gt; Displays a balanced character identifiable as both a beer and a mead, although the relative intensity of flavors is greatly affected by the sweetness, strength, base style of beer, and variety of honey used. If a beer style is declared, the braggot should have some character traceable to the style although the flavors will be different due to the presence of honey. If a variety of honey is declared, the braggot should feature a subtle to prominent varietal character (different varieties have different intensities). Stronger and/or sweeter braggots should be expected to have a greater intensity of flavor than drier, lower gravity versions. The finish and aftertaste will vary based on the declared level of sweetness (dry to sweet), and may include both beer and mead components. A wide range of malt characteristics is allowable, from plain base malts to rich caramel and toast flavors to dark chocolate and roast flavors. Hop bitterness and flavor may be present, and may reflect any variety or intensity; however, this optional character should always be both suggestive of the base beer style and well blended with the other flavors. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouthfeel:&lt;/b&gt; Standard description does not apply due to beer-like characteristics. Smooth mouthfeel without astringency. Body may vary from moderately light to full, depending on sweetness, strength, and the base style of beer. Note that stronger meads will have a fuller body. A very thin or watery body is undesirable, as is a cloying, raw sweetness. A warming sense of well-aged alcohol may be present in stronger examples. Carbonation will vary as described in the standard description. A still braggot will usually have some level of carbonation (like a cask bitter) since a completely flat beer is unappetizing. However, just as an aged barleywine may be still, some braggots can be totally still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall Impression:&lt;/b&gt; A harmonious blend of mead and beer, with the distinctive characteristics of both. A wide range of results are possible, depending on the base style of beer, variety of honey and overall sweetness and strength.

Originally, and alternatively, a mixture of mead and ale. A braggot can be made with any type of honey, and any type of base beer style. The malt component may be derived from grain or malt extracts. The beer may be hopped or not. If any other ingredients than honey and beer are contained in the braggot, it should be entered as an Open Category Mead. Smoked braggots may be entered in this category if using smoked malt or a smoked beer as the base style; braggots made using other smoked ingredients (e.g., liquid smoke, chipotles) should be entered in the Open Category Mead style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Commercial Examples:&lt;/b&gt; Rabbit&amp;iacute;s Foot Diabhal and Bi&amp;egrave;re de Miele, Magic Hat Braggot, Brother Adams Braggot Barleywine Ale, White Winter Traditional Brackett&lt;/p&gt;</reference></lookup><lookup name='Open Category Mead'><reference url='http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style26.php#1c' type='BJCP'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Open Category Mead is a honey-based beverage that either combines ingredients from two or more of the other mead sub-categories, is a historical or indigenous mead (e.g., tej, Polish meads), or is a mead that does not fit into any other category.
