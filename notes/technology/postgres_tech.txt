- A database cluster has 2 starting databases:
  - "postgres" - used by utilities, users, third parties
  - "template1" - used as a template for additional databases - don't use for actual work

- "The concept of roles subsumes the concepts of "users" and "groups"."
- "Database roles are conceptually completely separate from operating system users. In practice it might be convenient to maintain a correspondence, but this is not required."
- Database roles are global across a database cluster installation (and not per individual database).

- set up an unprivileged user for running the DB

- Before you can do anything, you must initialize a database storage area on disk. We call this a database cluster.
- A database cluster is a collection of databases that is managed by a single instance of a running database server.
- After initialization, a database cluster will contain a database named postgres, which is meant as a default database for use by utilities, users and third party applications.
- Another database created within each cluster during initialization is called template1.
- to initialize a database cluster, use "initdb"
  - must be logged into the PostgreSQL user account
