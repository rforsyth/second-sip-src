_____________________________________________________________
Itemized


- support blocking users
  - add approved field and set to false

- change password form separate from update profile

- show autocomplete of reference producers in new producer form

- stop storing producer canonical name as part of product (in case producer name changes)
  - need to break apart string and look up producer first then product

- get paging bar working in products -> notes (need to handle paging in controller)

- enforce visibility of producer / product in controller (don't populate @producer / @product)

- handle case where user registered but didn't follow verification link until perishable token expired


_____________________________________________________________
Security

- protect against sql injection on all queries that involve a like clause (autocomplete)
- render error pages that don't have a stack trace

_____________________________________________________________
Performance

- lists of notes access the producer name and product name - sometimes join these in from the DB?
