Hi <%= @taster.real_name %>,

Welcome to Second Sip!  You now have an online home for storing and organizing all of your tasting notes.  Here's a brief overview of the features:

You can access your homepage at any time here: <%= taster_url(@taster) %>.

Use the sharing feature to make any note private, public, or limited to your circle of friends.

The tags feature helps you organize notes so that you can find them easily.  They can also help you share them - for example, if you tag a number of notes with "gabf-2010" then you can use the browse feature to create a page that shows only those notes.

We hope you enjoy using it, and if you have any questions or concerns then feel free to contact us at customersupport@secondsip.com

Cheers,
The Second Sip Team
